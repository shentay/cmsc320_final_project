The $R^2$ score for poverty rate against income per capita is around $0.523$ and the score for poverty rate against median income is around $0.745$. The score for median income against poverty rate is relatively okay. \n",

The p-value found for both our models are $0$ which means that it is nigh impossible for both the pairs to exist given income has no effect on poverty rate. Hence, we will reject our null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis which is that there is statistically significant evidence that income has effect on poverty rates. Based on the graph, we can see that income inversely impacts the poverty rates."

Despite the increase in income, each county in Maryland experiences a different trend in their change of income where it may increase or decrease over time but will eventually lead to a higher income. However, the difference in trend does not impact the income distribution in Maryland which means that counties with higher incomes still remains as is and counties with lower incomes also remains. \n",
